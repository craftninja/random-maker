### How did you make this thing?

1. mkdir, git init, bundle init
1. Add rspec to gemfile, bundle (find current version in rubygems.org)
1. create spec file in spec directory named `something_spec.rb`
1. write your spec (see this spec file for pattern)
1. run it like after doing any coding at all.
1. Add the class in a lib folder named `something.rb` (note naming specifics between spec and lib!)
1. require the class at the top of the spec file (see spec file for pattern)
1. Start writing out your class in the lib folder
1. get that test to pass!
